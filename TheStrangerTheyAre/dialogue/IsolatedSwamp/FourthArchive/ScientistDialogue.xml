			<Page>I have never been too fond of my real name so if you must please call me "the Scientist".</Page>
			<Page>Before I left our ship, I was the head of the scientific committee. I was the first one to utilize green fire and invented the vision torch.</Page>
			<Page>I was however blind sighted by my leader's... ulterior motives. I was directly involved in the technology needed to directly build the ship.</Page>
			<Page>I didn't want to tear down our home planet, but it was his orders. He made me build that ship regardless of how unhealthy conditions were.</Page>
			<Page>When I left, I put my assistant in charge because I could not deal with the shame I felt. The committee thought I died in the crash, and didn't bother checking.</Page>
			<Page>And then, the simulation, this fake delusion we are all trapped in was built. I would never have approved of this prison. just another futile attempt to fix a mistake I warned them about.</Page>

			<Page>Ah yes, my family. There were four of us. Me, my wife, my son, and my infant daughter.</Page>
			<Page>Our youngest was born on the ship, but due to lack of nutrients and poor atmosphere, she passed away only a week later.</Page>
			<Page>&lt;size=20&gt;It was devastating...&lt;/size&gt;</Page>
			<Page>We decided that the ship was no longer safe for us, so we had to give terraforming a shot.</Page>
			<Page>We landed on the cloaked moon, far from our ship, but like a disease, it followed. Our son also didn't make it.</Page>
			<Page>We decided then and there that the only hope for us was to resurrect the husk of our old home; our home moon.</Page>

			<Page>My kind had a deep connection with nature, so we tried to take it with us on our voyage.</Page>
			<Page>Before we found that vortex in the sky, which you have called the "Eye of the Universe", we lived very simple and pleasant lives.</Page>
			<Page>We lived peacefully under the Ringed Giant, rafting its rivers, counting the stars, enjoying the simple pleasures of life.</Page>
			<Page>Some of us had hobbies; building furniture, playing board games, music, and even fishing.</Page>
			<Page>Most of my kind was very spiritual, some even worshipping idols and making sacrifices to ancient, now long forgotten gods.</Page>
			<Page>I was one of the few individuals who didn't care for worship, in fact my whole family was that way.</Page>
			<Page>It was only natural for my kind to sacrifice the planet to reach the "Eye of the Universe". After all that, we were never the same. No more gods, no more faith.</Page>

			<Page>The one locked down underground? We once knew each other but we had a... falling out. I don't like talking about it.</Page>
			<Page>The time on the Stranger really made him go insane! He became so hopeless about losing home that he deactivated the Signal Blocker.</Page>
			<Page>When he scanned The Eye... what he saw drove him to obsession. He thought it would end our suffering and reset the universe.</Page>
			<Page>The problem is, there's probably many other lifeforms out there. Why must we end their lives because we suffered? It is simply not yet time to activate The Vortex.</Page>
			<Page>However, despite his obsessions, I do wish for the times we had before.</Page>
			<Page>Anyway let’s change the topic before I start getting all emotional.</Page>

			<Page>This "Stranger" you speak of, do you mean our ship? That wretched place was awful.</Page>
			<Page>We started our voyage with 55 crew members. Many others were lost, including a popular singer. </Page>
			<Page>When we arrived, 20 died excluding my wife and I, while the other 33 remain trapped here in this simulation.</Page>
			<Page>We made a memorial at the bottom of a well, but we don't like to remember those painful memories.</Page>
			<Page>The death wasn’t the only toll it took on us. No animals lived till the ship was built and the trip was expected to take way less time than it did so by the time we arrived we barely had any food left.</Page>
			<Page>All those factors meant children could not grow. My two beautiful children died due to the incompetence of our leader.</Page>
			<Page>He knew we didn’t have the technology to do this the ability to play god like we did.</Page>
			<Page>Plenty of my kind have even taken their own lives due to this madness or starved to death due to lack of food. All while our leader said it was a "necessary sacrifice".</Page>
			<Page>When I came back, I was even more horrified to see what happened next. I saw all the burned reels, the burnt codes, and all my dead friends lying dead around an eerie, green fire.</Page>
			<Page>I then discovered this digital prison, and was disturbed to see my friends here......alive...</Page>
			<Page>So I coded in this whole area, and added an archive and a coma hall to ease the pains of the others, trapped here in this simulation for eternity.</Page>
			<Page>If only I was able to put a stop to it all...</Page>

			<Page>I specify in the green fire technology that you see all around us, but we have always been more spiritual than scientific.</Page>
			<Page>Before the green fire technology, our kind didn't have much at all. We were basically primitive.</Page>
			<Page>And when we did discover green fire, our kind used them as an early way to communicate basic ideas though raw fire is very fuzzy.</Page>
			<Page>But then one day, my father discovered how to focus and use it effectively.</Page>
			<Page>And years later, I invented the Vision Torch, which then lead to the development of computers, telescopes, and this vision torch you see before you.</Page>
			<Page>A colleage of mine also discovered some crystals which give off electricity when lighten up. A decade and some trial and error later we have the light sensors.</Page>
			<Page>Our ship's cloak is all natural resources we've mined from the cloaked moon. We didn't really have to configure it at all.</Page>

			<Page>Well, we can actually have up to 11 leaders, but almost always, one leader is more powerful than the rest.</Page>
			<Page>Our most powerful leader usually wears yellow clothing, but his advisors who we deem "The Council" typically dress in red.</Page>
			<Page>Our hierarchy system was directly related to the color of clothing. It goes from top to bottom: yellow, red, blue, green, gray, brown and rugged. The wealthy often had jewelry.</Page>
			<Page>However, our leader was a tyrant since we found that vortex. He doesn't listen to his advisors and may even imprison those who defy him.</Page>
			<Page>Those who refused to board the ship to reach the vortex were left home to starve, including one of our famous singers. Leaving home was truly a terrifying day.</Page>
			<Page>If only I had the spinal column to warn him about building the ship. Maybe we wouldn’t be here now.</Page>

			<Page>Angler's Eye? If you're talking about the cloaked moon, then I like what you named it.</Page>
			<Page>When we discovered what the vortex would do to our universe, we went there to mine out minerals for our ship's cloak.</Page>
			<Page>We found it when we were scanning the other planets in your system, but we predicted the trajectory incorrectly.</Page>
			<Page>For the terraforming plan, I was told by the Council to check to see if our homeworld was able to be terraformed, but we ended up crashing into the cloaked moon on our way there.</Page>
			<Page>The crash happened due to our false assumptions about its orbit.</Page>
			<Page>As my time on the cloaked moon went on, I found out that it was an "evil twin" of the ghost moon. Instead of copying just the terrain, some of the properties from the planet get imbued into it.</Page>
			<Page>I noticed the minerals on the planet have electric resistant properties, much like the jellyfish that once lived on it.</Page>
